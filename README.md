## Hairball

First attempt at a rust application. This is an implementation of a peer-to-peer encrypted, anonymous messaging protocol similar to bitmessage. All messages are encrypted with a users public sealing key, user generated sealing and opening keys are generated on start all peers should have a copy of all messages.
